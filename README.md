About
-----

Etude is a freelance teaching platform created by Michael Schwartze, Luke Plourde, Ian Russell, and Eric Hartman. The project was built using Ruby on Rails and with [Matrialize](https://materializecss.com/), a front-end framework. The entire project was completed in the length of a single two work-week sprint.
